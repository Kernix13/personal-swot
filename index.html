      <p>The SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to identify and evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses,
        Opportunities,
        and Threats related to your career development. It helps you understand your current position and plan for
        future
        growth. Strengths and weaknesses are internal factors, while opportunities and threats are external factors.
      </p>
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>There are 4 categories of questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>S = Strengths</li>
        <li>W = Weaknesses</li>
        <li>O = Opportunities</li>
        <li>T = Threats</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Some questions have multiple variations so I put them under a topic heading above the questions. Read them all
        and
        then choose ones that you can answer. I used the
        heading "Other questions" for all other questions.</p>
      <p>I did not copy questions that involve co-workers since I am currently unemployed, and I ran my own business
        for
        the past
        15 years.</p>

        <h2 id="notes">📌 Notes</h2>
        <h3>From Code:You</h3>
        <p>Strengths are the positive attributes and skills you possess that can help you achieve your career goals.
          These
          might
          include specific skills, experiences, or personal qualities. For example, being a strong communicator or
          having
          a unique
          technical skill can be considered strengths.</p>
        <p>Weaknesses are areas where you may lack skills or experience, which could hinder your career progress. An
          example of a
          weakness might be a lack of experience in a particular industry or skill set.</p>
        <blockquote>Identifying weaknesses is crucial as it allows you to work on them or find ways to mitigate their
          impact.</blockquote>
        <p>Opportunities in a SWOT analysis refer to external factors that you can leverage to advance your career.</p>
        <p>These could include industry trends, networking events, or new job openings. Recognizing opportunities allows
          you to
          take proactive steps to capitalize on them.</p>
        <p>Threats are external challenges that could negatively impact your career. These might include economic
          downturns,
          increased competition, or changes in industry regulations.</p>
        <blockquote>Identifying threats helps you prepare and develop strategies to minimize their impact.</blockquote>
        <p>By understanding both opportunities and threats, you can better navigate your career path and make informed
          decisions
          about your future.</p>
        <p>Conducting a SWOT analysis involves a few key steps.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First, list your strengths and weaknesses. Be honest and thorough in your assessment.</li>
          <li>Next, identify opportunities and threats in your external environment. Consider factors such as industry
            trends,
            economic conditions, and technological advancements.</li>
          <li>Once you have your list, analyze how your strengths can help you take advantage of opportunities and
            mitigate threats.</li>
          <li>Similarly, consider how you can address your weaknesses to prevent them from hindering your progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This analysis will provide you with a comprehensive view of your current career situation and help you
          develop
          a
          strategic plan for growth.</p>
        <p>After completing your SWOT analysis, it's important to use the insights gained <em>to set realistic career
            goals</em>. These
          goals should leverage your strengths, address your weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and prepare for
          potential
          threats.</p>
        <p>For example, if you identify a strength in project management and an opportunity in a growing industry, you
          might set a
          goal to pursue a leadership role in that field. Conversely, if a threat is an economic downturn, you might
          focus
          on
          building a diverse skill set to remain adaptable.</p>
        <p>Regularly revisiting and updating your SWOT analysis ensures that you remain aligned with your career
          objectives and can
          adapt to changes in your personal and professional environment.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>There are 4 steps to this analysis:</h3>
        <p>1. Create a SWOT matrix - S & W are in the first row of the matrix - these relate to internal
          factors - O & T in the 2nd
          row and are external issues or circumstances</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Positive</th>
              <th>Negative</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Strengths</td>
              <td>Weaknesses</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Opportunities</td>
              <td>Threats</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>1st column: S & O represent the positive or helpful factors</p>
        <p>2nd column: W & T represent the negative or harmful issues</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>2. brainstorm as many considerations as you can under each heading</strong></p>
        <p><strong>3. Prioritize the list</strong> - work out the top the 3-5 most important factors ie each quadrant
        </p>
        <p><strong>4. analyze the table by looking at each item and considering the actions that you can take</strong> -
          Questions to ask:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How can you play to or maximize your strengths?</li>
          <li>What personal development goals, people or processes could help to address your weaknesses?</li>
          <li>How can you exploit, expand, or multiply the opportunities?</li>
          <li>What control measures do you need to put in place to limit the threats?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now look for further relationships that you can identify across the columns, rows, and diagonals.</p>
        <p>Remember weaknesses are often a reflection of strengths - think about the opposite of each strength and
          weakness you
          have listed.</p>
        <p>Similarly, look at tthe flipside of external factors. You might find that threats can also provide
          opportunities, e.g. a
          competitor could be a potential collaborator, a failed project is an opportunity for learning.</p>
